				<p>
				In the current economic situation, it becomes mandatory for institutions
				to increase their networking opportunities through affiliations and
				partnerships. When partnerships are implemented correctly, the private
				sector can increase efficiency and choice, and expand access to education
				services, particularly for households that tend to be poorly served by
				traditional delivery methods.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Richfieldâ€™s relations with the private sector, encompass cooperation with
				business corporations, small and medium enterprises, professional and
				economic associations as well as other organizations of the business
				community, individuals, communities, parents and families.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Richfield recognizes that when we collaborate with some of the most
				ambitious organizations, we can multiply our impact in areas from education
				to economic development to poverty alleviation because of our ISO 9001:2015
				accreditation status! We have enduring partnerships and affiliations with a
				number of like-minded organizations and leaders who are eager to help drive
				global change and deliver true results.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Availability of exclusive and current online resources</li>
