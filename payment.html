				<h4>Edgars or Jet Card:</h4>
				<p>Visit any of our Campuses that accept Debit and Credit Cards, and you can
				also pay with your Edgars or Jet Card! Please note that your Edgars or Jet
				Thank U Card along with the Card Holder must be present for the transaction.
				Proof of ID will be required.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Debit or Credit Card:</h4>
				<p>A cardholder begins a credit card transaction by presenting his or her
				card to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The merchant uses
				their credit card machine, software or gateway to transmit the
				cardholder’s information and the details of the transaction to their
				acquiring bank, or the bank’s processor.
				</p>
				
				<h4>SnapScan:</h4>
				<p>Download the Snapscan App to your Mobile Phone or Tablet Device. Open the
				SnapScan app, tap on “Scan” and scan the SnapCode displayed at the shop. This
				identifies the shop and prompts you to enter the amount you wish to pay.
				Enter your PIN to secure and complete the transaction. Richfield will receive
				a notification containing a confirmation of payment from SnapScan and your
				account will be updated accordingly.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Standard Bank M65 Cash Payment:</h4>
				<p>Direct Cash Deposits can be made at any branch of Standard Bank using the M65
				form which can be obtained from your nearest Campus. This form can only be used
				at Standard Bank branches. Don’t forget to ensure that your name AND student
				number are on both sections of the form.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Electronic Funds Transfer (or CDI):</h4>
				<p>
				Name of Bank: Standard Bank of South Africa <br>
				Name of Account: Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology (PTY) Ltd. <br>
				USE YOUR ICAS NUMBER, INITIALS AND SURNAME AS REFERENCE.
